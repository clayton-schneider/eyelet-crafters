          If you can imagine it, Seidel can make it. Seidel is capable of
          producing any color, on any texture, to match any request, and process
          simultaneously through our independent hoist system. Our color and
          research department is dedicated to creating the closest color match
          through custom blending within a 24-48 hour turn around time. All of
          our dyes are organic, making the dyes environmentally safe. In
          addition to producing a variety of close color samples for each
          request, all of our colors are made to look the same in all light
          categories. Whether for outside use or indoor lighting, our color will
          remain visually consistent in all lighting conditions, in accordance
          with Seidelâ€™s standards. Additionally, we have unlimited finish and
          shade capabilities including interference, iridescent, pearlescent and
          other coloring effects complementing our finishing spectrum. <br />
          <br /> The bottom line is: We make aluminum beautiful. We create the finish
          from etched/matte over satin to bright and develop your custom color. If
          you are looking for ideas on how to differentiate your product from your
          competition, please contact us. We are looking forward to enhancing your
          product.
